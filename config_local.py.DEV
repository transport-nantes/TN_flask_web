# What am I doing?
# Check that this works on nantes-4 (that I can connect to the db and do an update)
# Indeed, that I can init the db.

# Then I must init the db.
# Define a model for visits.
# Write something to that model.
# Confirm that the model works on beta.
# Do this all on a branch.

# Then move on to the questionnaire.
